In Java, NIO stands for New Input/Output (introduced in Java 1.4).
It was designed to solve limitations of the traditional I/O system (java.io).

⭐ What is Java NIO?
======================
Java NIO is a modern alternative to traditional blocking I/O.
It supports:
    ✔ Non-blocking I/O
    ✔ High-performance data processing
    ✔ Efficient file and network operations
    ✔ Event-driven architecture (used in high-load servers)

🔑 Key Concepts in Java NIO
===============================
| Feature       | Java IO               | Java NIO                                  |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Mode          | **Stream-based**      | **Buffer-based**                          |
| Blocking      | **Always blocking**   | **Non-blocking available**                |
| Data Handling | One-way (read/write)  | Read/Write from **same object**           |
| Multiplexing  | ❌ No                 | ✔ **Selector** supports multiple channels |
| Performance   | Slower for large data | Faster, scalable                          |




🧱 Core Components of Java NIO
====================================
| Component        | Role                                               |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Channel**      | Connection to read/write data (like a pipe)        |
| **Buffer**       | Data container (memory block)                      |
| **Selector**     | Handles multiple channels with a **single thread** |
| **Path & Files** | Modern file handling utilities                     |



⭐ Channel
==============
    🚦 What is a Channel in Java NIO?
    --------------------------------------
    A Channel is a bi-directional communication interface used for reading and writing data between:
        ✔ Files
        ✔ Sockets
        ✔ Devices (like network connections)

    📌 Unlike InputStream and OutputStream (which are one-way), a Channel can read AND write — often at the same time.
    📌 Channels work with Buffers — data always goes:

    Channel ⇄ Buffer ⇄ Application
    📌 Channels are non-blocking & selectable, making them perfect for high-performance servers.


🧱 Channel vs Stream — Key Differences
=======================================
    | Feature       | Java IO Streams           | Java NIO Channels              |
    | ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
    | Direction     | One-way (read OR write)   | Two-way (read + write)         |
    | Performance   | Blocking                  | Can be non-blocking            |
    | Data Handling | Byte by byte              | Uses Buffers (bulk data)       |
    | Scalable?     | Hard for multiple clients | Designed for scalability       |
    | Integration   | No selectors              | Uses Selector for multiplexing |


📚 Types of Channels in Java NIO
=====================================
    | Channel Type                            | Description                             |
    | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
    | `FileChannel`                           | For reading/writing files               |
    | `SocketChannel`                         | TCP client connection                   |
    | `ServerSocketChannel`                   | TCP server socket (listens for clients) |
    | `DatagramChannel`                       | UDP communication                       |
    | `Pipe.SinkChannel / Pipe.SourceChannel` | IPC (thread-to-thread communication)    |
    | `AsynchronousFileChannel`               | Asynchronous file I/O                   |
    | `AsynchronousSocketChannel`             | Async network I/O                       |



📌 How the Channel Works with Buffer
=======================================
Basic data flow:

int bytesRead = channel.read(buffer);   // Read data into buffer
buffer.flip();                           // Prepare for read by app
buffer.get();                            // App reads data
buffer.clear();                          // Prepare for next read

➡ flip() and clear() are critical for switching buffer modes.









🎛 Channel Modes
=================

| Mode         | Meaning                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Blocking     | Channel waits for operations to finish      |
| Non-blocking | Channel returns immediately even if no data |
