What is callable?
=================
In Java, Callable is an interface within the java.util.concurrent package,
primarily used for concurrent programming, especially with ExecutorService and Future.
It represents a task that can be executed by another thread and,
unlike Runnable, it can return a result and throw checked exceptions.

Here are the key characteristics of Callable:
==============================================
- Returns a result:
    The call() method, which must be implemented by any class implementing Callable,
    returns a value of a generic type V. This allows you to retrieve the outcome of an asynchronous computation.

- Can throw checked exceptions:
    The call() method can declare and throw checked exceptions, enabling robust error handling in concurrent tasks.

- Used with ExecutorService and Future:
    Callable instances are typically submitted to an ExecutorService using its submit() method.
    This method returns a Future object, which represents the pending result of the Callable task.
    You can then use the Future to retrieve the result or check the task's status.
