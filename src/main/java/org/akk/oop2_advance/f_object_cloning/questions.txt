Common interview Q/A (quick)
=================================

1. Does super.clone() call the constructor?
    No — constructors are not called when using Object.clone().

2. Is clone deep by default?
    No — default is shallow.

3. Do arrays clone deeply?
    array.clone() creates a new array object and copies references — so elements are not deep-copied (unless primitives).

4. Can clone() be public?
    Yes; Object.clone() is protected. If you provide cloning to callers, override and make it public.
