1. Traditional switch (Before Java 12)
-------------------------------------------
    - switch was only a statement, not an expression.
    - You had to use break; to stop fall-through.
    - It couldn’t directly return a value.


⚠ Problems:
- Lots of repetition (result = ...;).
- Must remember to use break; (or it falls through).


🔹 2. Enhanced switch Expression (Java 12+)
------------------------------------------------
    - Can be used as an expression (returns a value).
    - Supports arrow syntax (->).
    - No need for break; anymore.
    - Uses yield when you have a block with multiple statements.





✅ Key Differences
====================
Feature	            Traditional Switch	            Enhanced Switch
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Return a value	    ❌ No	                        ✅ Yes (expression)
Fall-through	    ✅ Yes (must use break)	        ❌ No fall-through with ->
Multiple labels	    Limited (use stacked cases)	    ✅ Supported (case 3,4,5 ->)
Syntax	            Verbose	                        Concise
yield keyword	    ❌ Not available	            ✅ Used for block return
