🧩 What Are Records in Java?
----------------------------------
Records are a special kind of class introduced in Java 14 (preview) and made official in Java 16.
They are designed to be transparent carriers of immutable data — essentially data classes that automatically handle:
    Constructors
    equals()
    hashCode()
    toString()
    Accessors (getters)

🧱 Key Characteristics
===================================
Feature	                        Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Immutability	                All fields are final and cannot change after construction.
Compact syntax	                No need to write boilerplate code.
Value-based equality	        equals() and hashCode() are based on data, not object identity.
Transparent behavior	        toString() prints all components clearly.
Cannot extend other classes	    Records are implicitly final and extend java.lang.Record.
Can implement interfaces	    ✅ Yes, records can implement interfaces.


🚫 Limitations of Records
===========================
Limitation	                            Explanation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cannot extend another class	            Because they implicitly extend java.lang.Record.
Fields are final	                    You can’t make them mutable.
No setter methods	                    By design — immutability enforced.
Not suited for complex domain models	Best for simple data carriers (DTOs, config objects, etc.).


🧠 When to Use Records
--------------------------
✅ Use records when:
    You’re defining data transfer objects (DTOs)
    You’re holding configuration or value objects
    Equality is data-based, not identity-based
    You want clean, immutable, thread-safe data holders

🚫 Avoid when:
    You need mutable state
    You require custom inheritance hierarchy


🧩 In short:
Records are concise, immutable, data-carrying classes — perfect for modern Java programming, especially in APIs and microservices.
