What is Marker Interface ?
------------------------
A marker interface (or tagging interface) is a Java interface that contains no methods or fields,
serving as a "tag" to provide metadata about a class or object at runtime.

By implementing a marker interface, a class signals that it supports a specific behavior or property,
which the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), libraries, or frameworks can then recognize and act upon,
such as serialization with Serializable or cloning with Cloneable.
