What is class?



Type of Classes in Java
    - Normal Class
    - Abstract Class : must be inherited, because object of this class cannot be created
    - Final Class : can not be inherited
    - Record Class
    - Sealed Class : when you want a class that has the features of both Abstract class and Final class (something in between)
