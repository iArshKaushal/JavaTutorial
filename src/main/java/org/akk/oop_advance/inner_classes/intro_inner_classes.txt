🔑 What are Inner Classes in Java?
------------------------------------------
An inner class is a class defined inside another class.
👉 It is logically grouped with its outer class.
👉 Used to bind the two together, increase encapsulation, and make code more readable.



🏗️ Types of Inner Classes
---------------------------
1. Member Inner Class
    - Defined inside a class but outside any method.
    - Has access to all members (including private) of the outer class.
✅ Used when inner class is closely related to outer class functionality.





2. Static Nested Class
--------------------------------------
    - Declared with static keyword.
    - Cannot access instance members of the outer class directly.
    - Can only access static members of the outer class.

✅ Often used as helper classes (like Map.Entry inside Map).





3. Local Inner Class
-------------------------------------------
    - Declared inside a method, constructor, or block.
    - Can access final or effectively final variables of the enclosing scope.
✅ Useful for method-specific logic.
