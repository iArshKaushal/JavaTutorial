🔗 1. Association
-------------------------
👉 Association is the general relationship between two classes.

- It represents how objects are related to each other.
- It can be:
    - One-to-One (e.g., Person ↔ Passport)
    - One-to-Many (e.g., Teacher ↔ Students)
    - Many-to-One (e.g., Many Employees ↔ One Company)
    - Many-to-Many (e.g., Student ↔ Course)

📌 Key point:
- Objects are independent (life cycle not tied).
- Either can exist without the other.

Example:
--------------
- Student is associated with Teacher.
- If the Teacher object is deleted, the Student can still exist (association is loose).







🔗 2. Aggregation (Has-A relationship, Weak Association)
-----------------------------------------------------------
👉 Aggregation is a special form of association.
    - Represents a “Has-A” relationship.
    - The child object can exist independently of the parent object.
    - This is a weak relationship.

📌 Example in real life:
-------------------------
A Library has Books.
Even if the library is closed, books may still exist elsewhere.


Here, Library has Books. But Books can exist without Library.






🔗 3. Composition (Has-A relationship, Strong Association)
-------------------------------------------------------------
👉 Composition is a stronger form of aggregation.
    - The child object cannot exist without the parent object.
    - If the parent is destroyed, child objects are also destroyed.
    - Strong life cycle dependency.

📌 Example in real life:
-----------------------
    - A House has Rooms.
    - If the House is destroyed, the Rooms no longer exist.

Here:
    - Car owns Engine.
    - Without a Car, Engine has no meaning.
    - If Car is destroyed, Engine is also destroyed.






⚖️ Difference Between Association, Aggregation, and Composition
=====================================================================

Concept	            Relationship Type	      Life Cycle Dependency	        Example
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Association	        General relation	      Independent	                Student ↔ Teacher
Aggregation	        Has-A (Weak)	          Child can exist alone	        Library ↔ Books
Composition	        Has-A (Strong)	          Child depends on parent	    Car ↔ Engine
